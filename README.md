# Music-site
It is a song playing website built using JavaScript. This website allows a user to play & pause a song, and create a playlist. It also gives user access to shuffle or skip any song - along with other functionality you'd expect in a music app.

P.s Songs are changed to reduce the load time so actual song names could be different.
